# array-for-keypad-presses
##Displays OOP JavaScript

Given an input array of numbers that correspond to phone keypad presses, generate a list of all possible words that could be created using those numbers. For example, the number 2 could be the letters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

You may assume you have access to an api that accepts a string and returns true or false indicating whether or not that string is a word.
